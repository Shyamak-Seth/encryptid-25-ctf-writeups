# Hex Converter
Forget CyberChef. Our new hexadecimal converter can convert text to hex in absolutely no time! It runs locally, so you don't even need an internet connection. Check it out!

## Build and Deploy
Run the `deploy-locally.sh` script provided in the source directory, and a local deployment will fire up on your machine, running on whatever port you specify.

## Compile
If you wish to, you could compile the source code yourself with GCC, with the command `gcc -fstack-protector -o chall chall.c`

## Run locally
If you do not wish to spawn a Docker instance on your machine, or if you don't have Docker, don't worry! This challenge is solvable locally, too. Just run the `chall` binary provided to you, and it should work just fine.
