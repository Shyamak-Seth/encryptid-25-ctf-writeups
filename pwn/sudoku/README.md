# Sudoku
What is life, but a game of Sudoku?

## Build and Deploy
Run the `deploy-locally.sh` script provided in the source directory, and a local deployment will fire up on your machine, running on whatever port you specify.

## Compile
If you wish to, you could compile the source code yourself with GCC, with the command `gcc -o chall chall.c`

## Run locally
If you do not wish to spawn a Docker instance on your machine, or if you don't have Docker, don't worry! This challenge is solvable locally, too. Just run the `chall` binary provided to you, and it should work just fine.
